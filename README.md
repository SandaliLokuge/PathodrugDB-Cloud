# PathodrugDB

PathoDrugDB is a database designed to fetch detailed information on potential therapeutic targets in a bacterial species, including virulence factor, antibiotic resistance association, and available commercial drugs against the identified targets.
            It incorporates <a href="http://www.mgc.ac.cn/VFs/">Virulence Factor Database</a>, <a href="https://go.drugbank.com/">DrugBank</a>, and <a href="https://card.mcmaster.ca/">Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database</a> with the pre-computed results from our in-house pipeline to provide a complete review of the drug targets. 
            Our in-house pipeline is based on a subtractive genomics approach which follows a series of computational steps to eliminate host toxicity and shortlist genes that can serve as putative targets. This database is freely accessible to researchers to explore the pathogenic bacterial drug targets extensively.
